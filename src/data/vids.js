Was frequently quoted by Osama Bin Laden and other anti-House-of-Saud jihadists but Al Auda decisively broke with and refuted them following their string of attacks on the Kingdom and 9/11.  Widely popular today on Arabic TV and the website Islam Today.",

A prominent  journalist on Lebanon, Robert Fisk, disputes the claim that he was a spiritual leader of Hizbollah, although he was certainly an inspiration to all the Shi’a in Lebanon and elsewhere.  Major force of the “Shi’a revival” of the 2nd half of the 20th century, and a counterpoint to the Iranian branch of Shi’ism that lead to the Iranian revolution under Ayatollah Khomeini.",

According to a 2008 poll by the Anwar Sadat Chair for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, he was the most admired leader in the Arab world.  Even so, his approval rating among the Arab public was only 26%, indicative of the low opinion most Arabs have of their leaders.  Still a major force in the Middle East and seen by many as a symbol of Pan-Arab resistance to Israel and Western neo-colonialism  The following is a famous speech given during Ashura, the holiday commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, which is the most important time of the year for most Shi’a around the world.",

What is important to keep in mind is that neither he nor his school of thought (the Wilayat e-faqih theology) have ever been the dominant form of Shi’ism outside of Iran.  In terms of adherents today, the quietist Ayatollah Sistani of Najaf is more representative of the Shi’a worldwide than Khomeinism.",

They all have slightly different styles but impeccable Sunni credentials.  The clips are meant as a brief introduction only as there is very little material on the internet in English.  However, each Sheikh has thousands of hours of recorded sermons that are listened to by millions.",

In many cases they are the only ones translating this type of material into English, and their translations are by and large accurate.",
