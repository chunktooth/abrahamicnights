      <h2>A Note on Sources</h2>
      <p>This course is designed as a broad introduction to the root texts of Islam and their most important scholars and exemplars of the past century.  Since there is no area of Islamic studies that is not controversial to someone, the course does not attempt to be unbiased or ‘neutral’ in its selections but to provide as much balancing of diverse perspectives as possible within the framework of an undergraduate-type course.  Most of the authors listed here are widely published, reviewed and at the top of their respective academic fields.  Further information about them and often reviews or criticisms of their work can easily be found from an online search.</p>

      <p>Divine revelations allegedly transmitted in 7th century Arabic verse and prose to an illiterate prophet sitting in a cave would be a great challenge to translate into any modern language.  Tarif Khalidi’s translation was chosen because it transmits well the poetic force of the original, retaining some of the rhythmic and sonorous elements of the Arabic that have such a deep impact on the believer.  A review of his translation can be found <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/21/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview26'>[ here ]</a> Of “The Six Books” of canonical Sunni hadith collections, the two most authoritative ones are given here in their entirety.  These days the words Shariah, Islamic law and Islamic fundamentalism are tossed around frequently on screens and in print, generally without any knowledge of what those terms refer to beyond a few selectively edited soundbites or internet memes.  The Collections of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Moslem are what those terms refer to, more than anything else, now and for at least the last 1200 years.  There is simply no way of understanding what Islamic principles mean in theory and in practise without reading at least part of these two seminal texts.  Amazingly for two books which have ordered the everyday lives of millions, from Morocco to China and for more than a millenium, there is very little English language scholarship on these tomes for the non-specialist.  The two translations given here are not perfect (their provenance is likely two South Asian Moslems whose first language is not English) but they are complete, online, free, and they generally get the meaning across well.</p>

      <p>The Hadith compilation of Bill Warner, who is the only author listed here who can be considered a polemicist rather than a scholar (although he is a scientist first), is a convenient alternative to leafing through the thousands of pages of the canonical books.  As his purpose is to warn, he only lists those rulings which directly concern the non-believer or might shock someone with modern sensibilities.  Although his italicized comments are often superfluous and offer little context, his translations are accurate enough and the way he references the source is straightforward.  One can easily cross-check his references with Bukhari and Moslem.</p>

      <p>Jonathan Brown is here the main source for context on the Hadith collections and their role in Islamic society.  He is both an accomplished scholar and professor at Georgetown and a practising Moslem of European descent.  Naturally, that is controversial to some, and for more information about his role, the first page of a Google search provides plenty.</p>

      <p>For information about Hadith as practiced by schools other than the Sunni, one can read under the heading ‘Different Schools’ <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith'>[ here ]</a></p>

      <p>The Sira, or biography of Mohammed, is given here in full in the only English translation that exists, which is actually from a French translation of the original.  The language is a bit archaic by now but this is the closest thing that survives to a primary source account of the life of Mohammed.  The debate over the place of the Sira in the cannon and its transmission can be read about in the introduction.</p>

      <p>The godfather of political Islam is undeniably Sayyid Qutb.  The culmination of his fascinating life story and philosophical path is “Milestones.”  One could say it is to Islamist radicals what “The Communist Manifesto” or Lenin’s “The State and Revolution” was to 20th century socialist revolutionaries.</p>

      <p>Degrees of magnitude more excellent books about Islamic history were omitted than are present here.  However, for an extremely complex period of 1400 years that spans some of the most notoriously unstable regions of the globe, the history section of this course is a strong foundation.  Some of these books were hard to find and had to be borrowed or bought used, so please excuse their condition.</p>
